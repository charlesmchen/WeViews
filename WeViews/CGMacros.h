// section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
// and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
// patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
// by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
// with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute
// patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
// in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
// the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
// patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
// terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
//
// 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
// Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
// Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
//
// You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
// this License; and
//
// You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
// changed the files; and
//
// You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
// distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
// the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
// any part of the Derivative Works; and
//
// If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
// any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
// attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
// notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
// one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
// the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
// along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
// Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
// The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
// not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
// Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
// NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
// cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright
// statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
// license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
// modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your
// use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the
// conditions stated in this License.
//
// 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
// Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
// Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
// additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
// shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
// have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
//
// 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
// trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
// required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
// Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
//
// 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
// writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
// Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
// KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
// warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
// FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
// the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
// associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
//
// 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
// tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
// applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
// in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
// direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
// character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
// to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
// work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
// commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
// the possibility of such damages.
//
// 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
// or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
// acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
// and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
// obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
// responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
// to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
// incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
// accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
